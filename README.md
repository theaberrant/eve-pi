EVE-PI
======

Javascript page to assist in Planetary Interaction for Eve Online.  Specifically for single planet P2 production.

Downloading / Installing
------------------------

Download Repo, then run a web server with the project directory as root (I use nodejs, but whatever works).  I'll work on explaining this more later...

Navigate to index.html.

The only reason you need to use a webserver instead of just loading in a browser is because I load files as json.  This will probably change once I get bored with trying to be fancy...

Or just go to http://theaberrant.github.io/eve-pi/

Helping Out
-----------

I'm very open to suggestions, and am willing to take pull requests and whatnot.  I'm using this project to learn though, so if you do submit a pull request please be willing to teach me what is going on.
